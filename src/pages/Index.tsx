        <h5>Intro </h5>
        <p>
          The Intro to AI Safety Program is a 7 week, quarter-long course
          which explores the impact of increasingly powerful AI
          systems on society, explains the problems which the AI
          safety field is currently working on, and goes over
          active areas of research.

        <h5>MLAB</h5>
        <p>
          MLAB is an intensive technical machine learning course that builds a foundation for advanced techniques
          from basic skills.
          The course was created by Redwood Research (a leading AI safety research company based out of Berkeley, CA)
          to skill up potential AI safety researchers.

          This is the next step in AI Safety at UCLA.
          We recommend everyone who has completed the Intro Fellowship apply!
          Our program will consist of ~1 week's worth of MLAB 2 content over 6 weeks.
