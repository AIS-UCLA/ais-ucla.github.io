                AI Safety at UCLA works to ensure that the development of powerful AI systems is done safely.
                We are a research focused club which strives to provide students the tools and guidance to tackle the problems that interest them.
                Join us if you'd like to learn about AI safety and discover how we can use AI to build a better future.

          We think that the best way to make progress on the problem of AI safety is getting more people to focus their careers on AI safety research,
          in fields like <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/mech-interp-essay/index.html">mechanistic interpretability</a>
          , <a href="https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org/introduction/">adversarial robustness</a>,
          or <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-governance">AI governance</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We exist to help people interested in this problem skill up in machine learning, by working on projects that they can both learn from and add to their portfolios.

          We've worked on a variety of projects in the past. Here are some of our favorites!

                  In 2023, AI Safety at UCLA members trained a Reinforcement Learning agent to drive a car using
                  the Metadrive driving simulator.

                  In 2023, we ran a tournament to design AI algorithms that played Connect4.
                  An implementation of Deepmind's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero">AlphaZero</a> algorithm was the winner!

                  In this work, we simulate the popular online multi-player game 'Among Us'.
                  Inspired by works like CICERO, we use multiple models to tackle different parts of a full game.
