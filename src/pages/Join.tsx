        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
          The Intro to AI Safety Program is a 7 week, quarter-long course
          which explores the impact of increasingly powerful AI
          systems on society, explains the problems which the AI
          safety field is currently working on, and goes over
          active areas of research in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The program consists of a series of video and reading
          lessons which are accompanied by weekly, collective
          meetings that expand on the topics covered in the
          lessons. You can expect to learn from many prevailing
          sources in the field which will help you develop a solid
          research agenda that you may work towards in the
          following quarters.
        </p>
        <h4>Eligibility</h4>
        <p>
          <b>Everyone is welcome to apply</b> - no experience is required.
          Being open minded to novel ideas and spending time to deeply engage with them is all that is needed.
          That being said, a basic understanding of machine learning fundamentals or familiarity with contemporary
          AI research would provide a good baseline for the courseâ€™s content.
        </p>
