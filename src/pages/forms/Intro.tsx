        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
          The Intro to AI Safety Fellowship is a 6 week, quarter-long course
          which explores the impact of increasingly powerful AI
          systems on society, explains the problems which the AI
          safety field is currently working on, and goes over
          active areas of research.
        </p>
        <p>
          The program consists of a series of video and reading
          lessons which are accompanied by weekly, collective
          meetings that expand on the topics covered in the
          lessons. You can expect to learn from many prevailing
          sources in the field which will help you develop a solid
          research agenda that you may work towards in the
          following quarters.
        </p>
