          <h4>About</h4>
          <p>
            The Intro to AI Safety Program is a 7 week, quarter-long course
            which explores the impact of increasingly powerful AI
            systems on society, explains the problems which the AI
            safety field is currently working on, and goes over
            active areas of research in.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program consists of a series of video and reading
            lessons which are accompanied by weekly, collective
            meetings that expand on the topics covered in the
            lessons. You can expect to learn from many prevailing
            sources in the field which will help you develop a solid
            research agenda that you may work towards in the
            following quarters.
          </p>
          <h4>Eligibility</h4>
          <p>
            <b>Everyone is welcome to apply</b> - no experience is required.
            Being open minded to novel ideas and spending time to deeply engage with them is all that is needed.
            That being said, a basic understanding of machine learning fundamentals or familiarity with contemporary
            AI research would provide a good baseline for the courseâ€™s content.
          </p>
